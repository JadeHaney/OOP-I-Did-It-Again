# Logo Generator

## User Story
As a freelance web developer, I often need to create simple logos for my projects. However, hiring a graphic designer for every project can be costly. Therefore, I want to use a Logo Generator command-line application that allows me to quickly generate logos without the need for professional assistance.

## Description
The Logo Generator is a Node.js command-line application designed to meet the needs of freelance web developers like myself. With this application, I can easily generate logos by providing text, selecting colors for the text and shape, choosing a shape from a list (circle, triangle, or square), and saving the generated logo as an SVG file. This allows me to maintain a professional appearance for my projects without incurring the expense of hiring a graphic designer.

## Usage
To use the Logo Generator, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Run the application by executing the command `node index.js` in your terminal.
5. Follow the prompts to enter text, choose colors, and select a shape for your logo.
6. After providing all necessary information, the application will generate an SVG file named `logo.svg` in the root directory of the project.
